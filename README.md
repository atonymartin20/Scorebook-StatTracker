# Scorebook-StatTracker

This is a project that i built for a few reasons.  First, I wanted to build a larger project using AngularJS.  I had previously built one smaller AngularJS project, and I wanted something larger and harder to build next.  Second, when I worked at a previous job, I wanted to build something similar to this, but I did not have the coding ability to build it.  Finally, I feel like this would pair well with a former group project I helped build.
